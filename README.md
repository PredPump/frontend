## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Problem Statement

Prediction markets are powerful, but they can feel out of reach for most people. Here's why:

- **Too Many Restrictions:** Platforms like Polymarket limit users to creating markets only on topics supported by specific oracles (like UMA). If your idea doesn't fit within their framework, you're out of luck.
- **Complicated Resolutions:** Market outcomes can be slow and complex to resolve, creating frustration and uncertainty for users.

Prediction markets often fail to address real-world needs due to unnecessary restrictions. Here‚Äôs an example:

- **No Freedom to Create Markets:** Imagine the recent U.S. election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. You want to create a market to predict the winner, but platforms like Polymarket won‚Äôt allow it because the winning result isn‚Äôt readily available in their oracle data. This limitation prevents users from engaging in meaningful predictions on relevant, real-world events.

## üéØ Vision

At **PredPump**, we believe prediction markets should be open to everyone and easy to use. Our vision is to let everyone to create markets on any topic they care about, free from restrictions and technical hurdles, no need worried about the data. We‚Äôre building a platform where users have control, and where fairness and transparency are at the core of every interaction. Our ultimate goal is to make prediction markets fun, flexible, and accessible to all.
